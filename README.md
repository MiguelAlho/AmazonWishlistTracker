Amazon Wishlist Tracker

This project is a sort of spike to work on a couple of 
things AND solve a personal itch. 

On one hand, it will allow me to look at some book 
price trends for books on my wishlist; On the other, 
its a chance to test out a couple of tecnologies and 
patterns, namely:

* Queuing with Mass Transit and RabbitMq
* Data storage with MongoDb
* Unit testing with MongoDb abstractions
* Integration Testing with MongoDb
* Testing with message queues
* SpecFlow Acceptance tests
* Canopy UI tests
* Reviewing Web approaches
